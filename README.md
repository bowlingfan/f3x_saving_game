# F3X Saving Game
Demonstration of a ROBLOX Game utilizing the well-known building system, F3X building tools that has the ability to not only whitelist players, but also to save the entire game's builds with some limits.

This was made for a friend who stated they struggled with making builds peacefully as they were constantly being harassed, their builds were being griefed, and their builds would never save.

## Notes (PLEASE READ)

Though the scripts are imported and are free to be taken, they _**DO NOT INCLUDE ALL THE ASSETS**_ necessary for making all of the scripts work such as the reliance on Remote Events or User Interfaces. The scripts in this repository are meant to be used to help those seeking guidance on ideas over saving or whitelisting. Please make your own work.

Although F3X building tools supports the use of Welding, any form of welding **_WILL NOT_** be saved.
